Mammography databases are an invaluable tool for medical professionals and researchers when it comes to diagnosing, monitoring and treating breast cancer. A mammography database is a collection of images taken from multiple sources such as digital radiographs, ultrasound scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and computed tomography (CT) scans. Each image is stored in the database along with patient information such as age at diagnosis, family history of breast cancer or other relevant data points. The goal of these databases is to provide clinicians with comprehensive datasets that can be used for better decision-making when it comes to diagnosing patients who may have early signs or symptoms associated with breast cancer. 

The most common type of mammogram database stores digital images which are then classified according to certain criteria including size, shape and density patterns within each individual image. This allows the physician or researcher access specific information about a particular area without having to manually inspect every single scan they come across while conducting their research or making diagnoses decisions on patientsâ€™ cases. Additionally, many mammogram databases also feature advanced tools that allow users search through large amounts of data quickly using keywords related directly relatedto the patient's case in order to locate pertinent results more efficiently than ever before possible..
